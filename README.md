This is my personal work in solving the questions posed in the classic textbook:
["Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs"](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html)

Though I've copyrighted the code under the GNU license, I should point out that in order to make the code
operational I copied and pasted prerequisite code from the book itself. Certainly **I do not claim any
copyright** whatsoever regarding this code within my own. Notably, *usually*, one will be able to tell the
difference in that my code takes a different stylistic form when using parentheses than the book does,
though the bottom line is that if the code exists in the book, it's from them, and if it doesn't it's from me.

Currently this work is ongoing as I am finishing up Chapter 3, meaning I have two more chapters left (I've already
read Chapters 4,5; it's only a matter of rereading and practicing). Beyond that, I intend to go through the exercises
a second round---but writing it up in C++ template code---which will serve the dual purpose of further practice as well
as building up more code for my personal *nik* library also hosted here in GitHub.

Pijariiqpunga.
